   <h1>Silverback Gorilla</h1>
  
      <p> Silverback Gorillas are around six feet tall – about the height of an adult male – while females are around five feet tall. Silverback gorillas weigh approximately 350 pounds- about twice the weight of normal adult man.  Gorillas are herbivores, and eat only plants. They spend most of their day foraging for food and eating bamboo and leafy plants. Silverback gorillas were not even known to exist until 1902. Today, their habitat is being destroyed when people use the land for farming and the trees for fuel. Gorillas are also killed by poachers and sometimes get caught in poacher’s snares meant for other animals. The Silverback Gorilla is the most endangered species of Gorilla.</p>
